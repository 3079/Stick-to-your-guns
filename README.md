# Stick-to-your-guns

You can play the game [here](https://chertkov.itch.io/stick-to-your-guns)

Stick to you guns was imagined by us to be a quick paced bullet hell top-down shooter kinda like Hotline Miami or Enter the Gungeon.  
You play as a slime and all the weapons on the level stick to you. Your starting weapon has infinite ammo but all the other weapons on the level have a finite amount.  
The game was made in just under 2 days for the 2020 GMTK game jam, so there's not much more than just a barebone concept.

Your enemies are also slimes to whom the same rules apply (the AI is a little rough around the edges)

There are 4 weapon types in the game: a pistol, a shotgun, a machine gun and a railgun.

The idea was that with some more development the game could have become a chaotic and fun bullet hell and I believe there's really some potential for that.

I was responsible for most of the technical aspects of the game, i.e. programming and level building.  
Music was made by my teammate [Chertkov](https://chertkov.itch.io/).  
The tilemap used is from [Kenney](https://www.kenney.nl/).

The game was made using Unity 2019
